        <h2>In the Morning before the Haircut Inspection</h2>
        <br>
        <p> I hoisted my Peugeot racing bicycle over the railway tracks and wheeled it up the dirt path leading to Templeton Road. I glanced down at my watch. A thorn from the overgrown bushes beside the tracks caught on my jersey, it was 6.50. Sometimes girls from the sister school across town used that path to walk to the city centre, today I was alone. Our school was boys only.
            Emerging from the path and the bushes, I could see the long rectangular brick structure of the school on the hill, across a depression filled with a swimming pool and a large field which served as a cricket field or two rugby fields, depending on the season. My bicycle glided down Templeton Road towards the school’s steel gates. </p> <br>
            <p>           I braked at the massive white gates, clenching the palms of my hands round the handlebars. To my left, frost covered the two rugby fields and to my right stood the swimming pool, the town’s only Olympic sized facility. A flock of haadidas called across the sky, encrusted with distant cirrus clouds. I could smell the newly applied oil on my bicycle and a trickle of sweat inched down my back, creating a momentaneous, almost unbearable itch as unpleasant as the dry remains of the breakfast cereal on my palate. </p>
 <p>           I didn’t want to enter the school grounds just yet, I wanted to savour my freedom. In a few minutes, I would become the robot suggested by my grey uniform, the orange stripe of the school colours embellishing the neckline of my jersey like a noose around my neck. It was as if the school removed my soul. It made me feel powerless. At any rate, I knew I had two more years before I would be free to leave at the age of eighteen. So until then I would simply concentrate on being free in my mind and do what I had to do at the school, within limits. As a small protest I had grown my sideburns longer than the other boys. In my bag, decorated with a drawing of the band Moose, was a small, black book called “The Problems of Philosophy”. I thought it was the key to escaping this reality.</p>
            To combat the cold of the winter’s morning, I was wearing my grandfather’s gloves from the second world war. They were khaki on the rear sides and brown leather on the hands. My grandfather’s brothers died in the war. They were 21 and 23. 
            I scratched my head and turned involuntarily towards the Olympic-size swimming pool. Its pristine water looked ice cold in the morning. The water was very blue. I hated swimming lessons in the pool. They created a sensation of vulnerability in my inner thighs, the strong scent of chlorine everywhere as we sat about almost naked, in swimming costumes, in the changeroom. Next to the fifty meter long pool was a smaller, deeper pool with a diving board above it, that rose 3 meters into the air. 
            I remembered James “Polecat” Poleman inching across the board on his arse, terrified by the height of the drop. Van der Meulen, the sports teacher, directly out of the army, stood at the edge of the pool in his tracksuit, squinting up at Polecat with his perpetual scowl. It must have been some change, from ordering grown men with guns around to having to deal with twelve-year old boys in Speedos and awkward, unmuscular bodies.
            “You must jump off the board.” Polecat continued to edge towards the end of the board, his eyes wide open, his thin limbs angular and awkward. Water dripping from our adolescent torsos, we stood beside van der Meulen mesmerised by this spectacle, some boys laughing, some, like myself, grateful that the attention was accorded to Polecat and not themselves. His teeth biting into his lower lip, Polecat swung down, grasping the board, his body dangling towards the water and his arms tensed as if he wanted to pull himself up to safety once again. 
            “Just let go,” grunted Van der Meulen. Polecat’s eyes widened, he looked down and up, and then when his blue hands could no longer support the weight of his own body, he crashed into the water three metres below, sending a mist of spray onto the gooseflesh of my skin. 
            “That’s right,” said van der Meulen, a begrudging respect in his voice for Polecat’s achievement momentarily erasing his illy concealed scorn for the physically challenged boy. What a bully, I thought and shivered again. 
            Shaking my head to dispel the memory and staring at the empty pool in the morning sunlight, I gripped the handlebars tightly and then remembered that today was haircut inspection. Van der Meulen was in charge. I ran my hand through the crew cut I had received from Loretta at the hairdressers next to the cathedral on Friday the week before. I smiled to myself. On the way to the haircut, I had been carrying the ten rand fee in the pocket of my jeans. As I approached the cathedral, foraging in my pocket, I had realised with dismay that the banknote was gone, I must have dropped it. All that was left was a two rand coin. I turned round instinctively to look for it and saw a young black man snatch up the green banknote from the pavement, furtively glance around and then stride away if nothing had happened. 
            “Hey,” I said jogging towards the man and feeling relief that I wouldn’t have to face van der Meulen without a haircut, “Sorry! That’s my money!”
            The man stopped and looked around at me, his brow furrowed. His clothes were slightly ragged and he smelt strongly of tobacco.
            “What money?”
            “The money you just picked up.”
            “No”, he muttered, looking at the ground, “there was no money.”
            “But yes,” I replied, “I saw you picking it up.” He shook his head. I knew I had to think fast. I took out the 2 rand coin. 
            “Look, I’ll give you this if you give me the money back.” He scowled, hesitating. 
            “OK,” he blurted out. 
            I handed him the coin, relieved by the strange deal I had made and put the banknote back in my pocket. 
            The memory made me smile. Glancing towards the school, and realising that my time to savour freedom was nearly up, I ran my hand through my cropped hair which Loretta had cut expertly, creating a well-proportioned balance with my face which I had inspected in the mirror the evening before, whiling away the remaining hours of the holiday. But the relief I had felt then, was now tinged with guilt. The black man certainly needed the money more than I needed the haircut. 
            I kicked off from the ground and pedalled hard to generate the speed needed to glide up the hillside leading to the school. It was technically the back end of the school, the official entrance was on the other side, where the headmaster’s office was situated next to the schools coat of arms. I enjoyed the satisfying sensation of speed as I guided the bicycle towards the ramp outside the back door, aware of the flame trees lining the pavement beside the school, infested with mopani worms. I alighted from the bicycle and lifted it up the stairs. 
            I was early, there were no other boys around. I breathed deeply before pushing back the heavy door and wheeling the bicycle through a narrow hallway that led to the bicycle shed. The shed was a pit below the main quad where all the boys at the school from 14 to 18 gathered for morning lines, to be followed this morning, I couldn’t forget, by the hair inspection. 
            I pushed the bicycle into one of the metal structures intended as a support and secured it with my bicycle chain. Then I slung my satchel onto my back and returned to the hallway turning into the long corridor on the ground floor of the two storey building. We had biology first thing that morning at 7.30. The biology lab was at the other extremity of the building and I walked the length of the long corridor, my black Bata Toughees echoing on the faded grey linoleum. 
            Brett Graham and Panchab were loitering beside the biology lab door having stacked their bags against the wall, which I did in turn. 
            “Howzit,” I greeted them. 
            “Howzit,” replied Brett, leaning against the wall, Panchab nodded. Brett ran his hand across his pale cheek and through his platinum blonde hair. Panchab licked his lips. 
            “Bari, got a chick yet?” he said. I raised my eyebrows. “You think your sideburns make you look like Elvis Presley.”
            “When you going to grow up, Panchab,” said Brett rolling his eyes and smiled at me. 
            A tall figure appeared at the end of the corridor, near the bicycle shed. Damesh Dullabh swept across the linoleum towards us on luxury mocassins, his mop of dark hair bouncing 
            “My old man’s in a pink in his Mercedes,” grinned Damesh. “He wouldn’t drive me up to the school. Said some of his clients had been stealing from the shops in the township yesterday.” I thought of the man who had picked up my ten rand note, could Damesh’s Indian father really miss the odd pilfered packet of biscuits after he had made so much money setting up his shops in every corner of the township. 
            Damesh raised his hand and we high fived. He ran his hand through his hair again. I wondered if he would pass the hair inspection.
            “Looking good for the hair inspection Bari,” he smiled and then wrinkled his face in mock consternation. “Not so good for Mohammed, van der Meulen’s gonna have his balls for breakfast.”
            Panchab giggled. 
            “Says he won’t shave his moustache off. Says it’s proof of his manhood.” I smiled to myself, the arrival of the Muslim and Hindu boys since the start of multiracial schooling in 1987 thankfully represented a challenge to white Afrikaners like Van der Meulen, a reminder to them that their vision of life was not the only one in South Africa.  
            The boarders were now arriving, completing their journey from the hostel where they slept on the other side of the school, next to the main rugby field. They slouched towards us, dragging their shoes on the linoleum, as if their constant residence on the school grounds bestowed ownership of it on them. Burts wore his perpetually stupid smile on his meaty face, a subversion of our reality through his disorientating humour. Bebsta, a grin contorting the pimples on his face, tossed his satchel against the wall and flexed the biceps which he had shaped lifting dumbbells in the weights room. He lummied Panchab on the shoulder. 
            “Hi Panny, looking sharp there buddy,” he drawled. Raubenheimer and Goat, crowded around Panchab who blinked rapidly. Raubenheimer laughed.
            “There’s a runt born every day.”
            I had had enough. I walked up the corridor and took the stairs leading to the upper floor of classrooms. Rowan van Aarde passed me on the stairway. He smiled  and I greeted him. 
            “Zinkumbucht!” Burt’s broad grin radiated up from the corridor. Rowan smiled. We walked up to the foyer, beside the noticeboard where all the sporting teams were pinned and then walked out onto the quad, where innumerable teenagers where playing a game known as Four Square, defending sections of the concrete on the quad through controlling a tennis ball. 
            I walked round the outside music block. Somebody was practising “Happy Birthday” in the music room on a violin, the notes scraped out with rasping inaccuracy. Brent Meistre and the dayboys were lounging on the concrete walkway. Gareth Sweetwater was talking to Brent about a new album, his tongue coming out of his mouth between sentences in his enthusiasm. I glanced down at my watch, there was one minute to morning lines and then haircut inspection. I breathed in deeply, smelling the freshly cut grass off the rugby fields as my heartbeat accelerated. There was no reason to be worried, my hair was short, but somehow I was on edge, as always.
            Then the bell rang to start the school day, a piercing sound that entered my brain like a shaft of metal. Brent Meistre and the other boys slowly raised themselves to their feet, dusted off their uniforms and their faces hardened into the expressions needed to face the day. There was silence..</p>
