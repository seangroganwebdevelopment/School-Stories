        <h2>Haircut Inspection</h2>
        <p>The Haircut Inspection
            The bell cut into my brain like a razor blade. 
            
            “Happy Birthday” ended abruptly in the music room. Brent Meistre and the dayboys shuffled round the music block, tucking their shirts into their trousers. I followed onto the quad as boys streamed onto the concrete from the steps before the main school building. In the throng, I was engulfed by the scent of hair gel, deodorant and the Deep Heat cream smeared onto boys’ thighs to treat rugby injuries. 
            My heart was throbbing. I could taste blood inside my cheek, which I was biting. I closed my eyes onto a universe of light points behind the eyelids. 
            “Come, move your arse Burts,” said Damesh. 
            I opened my eyes again. The boys were forming lines by grade. I joined the Standard Eight line, towards the back. Carrots Daigh stood behind me and Burts ahead. I could make out the tall figure of Dahmesh Dullabh midway up the line. I glanced at the line on the left, where the older boys stood, and recognised the stolid form of Custard Kemp leaning against the orange brick wall, rubbing the stubble on his chin. 
            I remembered the beginning of the year, riding the old Mercedes bus to Port Elizabeth. Custard Kemp had called some of us from the under-sixteen cricket team to join the second team at the back of the bus. 
            “Have you seen anything like this my ouk?” he asked, pushing his face close to mine. I could smell cigarette smoke on his breath, his stubble prickling my cheek as he pulled a photo from his sock. “Are you an explorer, a bushwacker?”
            I was eager for the attention, caught between the older boy who seemed to belong to a more interesting world. But the others were silent, complicit in Custard’s performance, and avoided my gaze. The photograph was of a naked woman lying on a sandy beach. I wanted to say something smart, to fit in, but Custard had already lost interest. 
            “Go back to where you came from,” he ordered, waving the photograph at me. He pointed to the woman’s hairy genitals. “That’s what I call real bush. And you ain’t no bushwacker, man.” 
            The same feeling of ambiguity rose in me as I refocused on Custard’s stubble in the matric line. I turned away and closed my eyes, trying to return in my mind to the gathering. What had most struck me most in the bus was the silence of the other older boys, their unwillingness to engage, complicit in Custard’s abuse like the white community’s complicity in apartheid. 
            To dispel my disquiet, I turned to my right, where the younger boys were standing in the standard seven and six lines. Mohammed “Saddam” Hussain was a few metres away, the boy with the moustache Damesh had mentioned earlier in the corridor. I couldn’t see the growth of adolescent hair, but sensed its prickliness pushing through his soft, youthful upper lip. I raised my hand to scratch my sideburns. They increasingly caused me anguish. Although van der Meulen hadn’t reproached me before, they were an act of rebellion that could cause many problems at this school, where uniformity and conformity were absolute values. It was not enough that my hair bristled in the standard army crewcut. 
            Silence fell over the boys. A cool breeze blew down from Taunton Road behind the quad where the school’s main gates stood. Headmaster Simpson emerged from the foyer beside the notice board, followed by the Deputy Headmaster, the Head Boy of the school Tyrone Clarke in his blazer and Van der Meulen in an Adidas tracksuit.  
            Above the teachers’ heads, behind the glass above the door, hung two massive posters displaying a black hammer and sickle with a red border etched in wax crayon. “Vote for the South African Communist Party,” read the inscription below the emblem.
            I smiled to myself, looking at the back of Burts’ thick head. He and I had drawn those posters for Mr Grant’s history class, where we were conducting a mock election to learn about South Africa’s new democratic dispensation. Burts and I had chosen the Communist Party and his status as a boarder at the hostel and the boldness of our posters made us the leading candidates, aside from any political considerations. We had tried to put up a poster above the headmaster’s office door as a joke, but he had taken it down, saying it might send the wrong message. Brent Meistre had told us about a Policemen’s Ball, which his father had attended. “What is this country coming to,” one policemen said after seeing our poster. I loved the freedom and the idea of change that it embodied. 
            Headmaster Simpson cleared his throat. The last murmurs died down, and I heard a fly buzzing around my head, landing briefly on my cheek before foraging through my sideburns. 
            “Good morning boys,” intoned Simpson, elevating his stocky figure, which had earned him the nickname Chunky, and clasping his hands piously before him. “Let us pray”. 
            The ensuing silence intensified as the boys lowered their heads, most closing their eyes. I looked straight ahead, observing, as I liked to do. A car descended Taunton Road, its exhaust spluttering at the main gates.
            “Our Father who art in Heaven…” mumbled the choir of teenagers. 
            In the row to my right, Graham Wischart’s lips moved slowly in prayer beneath an expansive blond fringe. I didn’t know him well, but remembered a poem that he had published in the school magazine. It described a boy lying in bed at midnight, hearing a burglar trying to break into his house. “Why did he want to break in,” he thought, “I have spent my whole life, trying to get out.” 
            I had also been trying to be free my whole life I thought, and as I scratched my sideburns again, I thought of Burts’ intentionally stupid smile, derived from a humour so overwhelming that it undermined the whole reality of our school routine.
            UP TO HERE
            “... give us our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses…” mumbled the boys.
            “... lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil….” 
            In the same magazine that Greg Wishart’s poem had appeared I used to look at the pictures of the woman teachers. A feeling of powerlessness came over me, of guilt, as the words of the prayer continued like a powerful incantation. 
            “... for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory…” 
            I turned around slightly. 
            My piano teacher Gillian Williams was standing at the music block door, her slim figure covered in a pair of tartan trousers and a silk blouse and her arms folded over her slight chest. I remembered her words: “the Artists are more interesting for their failings.” This sentence had helped me to accept my own guilt, the constant feeling that something was wrong. 
            “Amen…” I pronounced the final word of the prayer myself, my only contribution to the daily incantation. It felt strangely cathartic, as though our day could only now begin. Perhaps it was out of habit, perhaps it was the odd quietness of the prayer and the stillness of the boys, who normally couldn’t sit still.
            The headmaster unclasped his hands and stared down at us. Van der Meulen raised his head. 
            “We should remember boys, to prayer,” said Chunky. The words sounded ridiculous to me. Chunky was no saint. It seemed odd to me too that he was also talking to boys like Damesh and Saddam, what did Chunky’s prayers mean to them. 
            “It is important to keep a pathway open to God.” That was Chunky’s sermon over for the day. “I have an announcement to make,” he continued, 
            I looked at Zimkumbucht up ahead of me. “The Emporer of the World”. I remembered going to his house and he showing me the world that he had constructed in his back yard. The only place he properly felt in control of perhaps, it reminded me of Chunky. 
            “Dale College are coming to play us on Saturday, I want to remind you how important this fixture is. I want you all to attend and to be on your best behaviour and to show the school spirit that Graeme is so proud of.” I remembered the rugby war cries, the barbarism of the boys’ chanting against the opponent schools.  
            “It is up to you to make this school the great place that it is.”
            Headmaster Simpson took two steps backwards and van der Meulen stood forward, a scowl contorting his features. 
            “Right,” he growled as Simpson retreated into the foyer, “you boys come up past me, starting from standard six for the hair inspection.” His harsh Afrikaans accent was grating on my ears. The Headboy, Tyrone Clarke, resplendent in his blazer, with gold trimmed awnings, pulled up a black exercise book from the seams of his trousers. 
            A young boy, the first victim of this ritual, climbed with bobbing steps up the seven steps towards van der Meulen, who raised his right hand revealing a pencil. The blond boy stood at right angles to van der Meulen, who raised the pencil to his mop of hair. The pencil was inserted into the boy’s hair, just above the earlobe. The blonde tuft of hair displaced by the pencil covered his ear, the cardinal sin. 
            “Fail!” bawled van der Meulen. Tyrone Clarke took the boy’s name and jotted it down in his exercise book. I could almost feel the stinging nettles of the headmaster’s garden in my hands that had accompanied my days of detention for previous hair inspection failures. I nervously scratched my sideburns and wondered if I would be joining the boy at detention. 
            “Next!” thundered van der Meulen. 
            Another small boy bounded up the stairs under the ominous blackness of the hammer and sickle. His head was covered in a small fuzz of stubble, it was difficult to say that he had any hair on his head at all. Van der Meulen scowled at the stubble, nodded and the boy continued into the foyer, swallowed by the school corridor. 
            A palpable tension was gripping the lines of boys. The first boy’s failure had tensed me up and I could feel my sideburns burning into my skin. They felt ridiculous to me now, my small act of rebellion and devotion to freedom a weak statement that would result in my punishment. 
            I remembered Chunky’s office, where I had been caned the previous year, when I was one of the boarders living at school, for bunking out at midnight with Bebsta and Burts to swim naked in the school’s Olympic sized pool. 
            “Don’t be stupid,” Chunky had said, raising the thin stick of his cane, which then whistled through the air before impacting with the flesh of my bottom. As the sting of impact subsided and looked at the headmaster’s trophy cabinet beside his desk nestling into the thick gray mohair carpet. 
            “Next!” bawled van der Meulen, brutally returning me to the present from my memory. His pencil produced another tuft of hair that protruded fully over the ear. 
            “Fail!” he bawled. A palpable shudder ran through the boys. Beside me, Saddam furiously fingered his upper lip, obviously preparing for the confrontation with van der meulen. He glanced repeatedly up at the Communist party poster and then down at his polished black shoes, as if he didn’t know where to look. I tried to restrain my impulse to bite my nails and fingered my sideburns. They felt prickly, like barbed wire. 
            The boys moved faster into the school, disappearing into the corridor like sheep at an abattoir run. Every third boy seemed to fail and be entered into the headboy’s black notebook. The thinning body of boys on the quad seemed tense, like a string stretched too tightly over a violin. 
            Mohammed “Saddam” Hussein inched closer to the stairs, still fingering his moustache. The fact that I couldn’t see it, made it seem all the more terrible. 
            “Jesus,” whispered Damesh Dullabh up ahead, “who farted?” The tense atmosphere was the catalyst I thought. 
            “Burts, was that you?” 
            The line to our right moved forward and Saddam found himself at the bottom of the stairs. The boy preceding him passed under the hammer and sickle shaking his head, his locks that had caused him to be placed in Tyrone Clarke’s detention book bouncing up and down. 
            Saddam slowly mounted the stairs, his hand still stuck to his upper lip, as if he would reveal the moustache to van der Meulen in a moment of madness. 
            “Right,” barked van der Meulen, his pencil poised near Saddam’s ear. Saddam slowly drew himself upwards, until he appeared almost as tall as van der Meulen, despite the gym teacher’s height. His finger slowly descended, in tandem though, with van der Meulen’s pencil. The teacher’s mouth opened and his eyes rolled in his recoiling head, as if confronted with a sight of such horror. 
            Burts uttered a chortle in front of me, echoed by Carrots behind me. 
            “What in the name of … God? Heere!” blasphemed van der Meulen in Afrikaans, his voice strangely thin and quiet. He looked up at the hammer and sickle, uncharacteristically uncertain, then focussed on Saddam’s face, his eyes narrowing in his rugged features. 
            “Wat is dit op jou lip? What is that … ding on your lips?” Language was failing him. Without backing down, Saddam fixed him coldly in the eye. 
            “I am a man now,” he said and without a backward glance proceeded to enter the foyer and merge with the mumbling mass of boys forgetting the hair inspection and starting their day. Van der Meulen watched him go out of the corner of his eye, but said nothing, and as the next victim rose on the stairs, it was obvious to me that in his confusion he would fail to take any action over the moustache. 
            Van der Meulen’s uncharacteristic look of confusion had remained on his face as I in turn mounted the stairs sharply on the heels of Burts, who van der Meulen had let pass into the foyer without so much as raising his pencil. Tyrone Clarke was also looking distracted, fiddling with the black exercise book. 
            I glanced at van der Meulen, who looked at me with eyes glazed like a fish. It was obvious that he couldn’t see my sideburns which I scratched again. Raising my eyebrows in relief and surprise, I passed into the foyer. 
            I seemed like a different country already, the border to it the hammer and sickle and the massive door through which I could see boys streaming towards me passed the dazed van der Meulen. Whether the guilt was with him too, I didn’t know. 
            “Ah Burts!” moaned one, “did you fart?” 
            The smell dispelled the tension and Burts stupid, orchestrated smile became king, mocking the reality that the past authorities had spent so long orchestrating. Somewhere in the corridor ahead, the moustache was passing, like the iron of a revolutionary sword or sickle, breaking the connection to the past, which in some small way, my sideburns had tried to emulate. 
            “Jesus Burts!” cursed Damesh, and then said something unintelligible in Hindi, which presumably hailed the new smell of our new country.
